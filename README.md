### Implementation of the [Research Paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1505.04597v1.pdf): UNet Convolutional Networks for Biomedical Image Segmentation

In this project, the architecture proposed in the paper has been applied to the scope of Satellite Imagery.

The [Dataset](https://humansintheloop.org/resources/datasets/semantic-segmentation-dataset-2/) is provided by a space center in Dubai for annotated for multiclass semantic segmentation.

A Google Colaboratory [link](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1sL0Up6n0Kpc4vle7n88wG9WLOEyaOrqO?usp=sharing) for Model Semantics 

and another [one](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1acFicwpEBoh-yEbn6IhlyWNynOV4wW55?usp=sharing) for Model in action with Gradio: Upload any satellite image and get its equivalent predited mask which can be downloaded.
